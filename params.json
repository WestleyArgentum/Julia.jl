For Base packages, check if the package you seek is listed in the [built-in package manager on github](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl) or check the [metadata for registered Julia packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/)\r\n\r\nJoin the [http://julialang.org/community/](mailing list) or head over to [#julia on irc.freenode.net](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) for a live chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nSome tips for submitting a [pull request (PR)](https://github.com/svaksha/julya/pulls):\r\n* Add your link as per the topic, with notes (if any) to the respective (.md) pages in the repo.\r\n* For broken links submit a bug report, or replace the broken URI, then submit a PR.\r\n* For Documentation and cookbooks, check if it matches the categories listed, if yes, then list it against *DOC*, else use the Cookbook.md page.\r\n\r\n\r\n# LICENSE \r\n* This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
